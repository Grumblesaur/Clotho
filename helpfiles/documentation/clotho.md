# Clotho
Clotho is a tool for playing tabletop RPG games over Discord. It features a simple expression-based programming language for automating common RPG actions, and for the most essential features, no prior programming experience is required. Familiarity with basic arithmetic and [dice notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dice_notation) is sufficient.

While most Discord bots are run by their developers for any server to add them, a major design goal of Clotho is to make it easy to run one's own instance of the bot for a private server or group of servers. Furthermore, bot operators with some knowledge of Python will be able to write their own Python plugins for the bot, for instances where Dicelang is too limiting.
